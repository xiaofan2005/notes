## Some believe that the students should take a one-year break before attending college. Do you agree or disagree with the opinion and why?《有些人认为，学生应该在上大学之前休息一年。你是同意还是不同意这个观点，为什么？》

There are varying opinions regarding whether or not students should take a one-year break before attending college. 

In my opinion, taking a one-year break can be a great opportunity for students to gain valuable experiences and mature before entering college. During this time, they can explore their interests, volunteer, learn new skills, and gain work experience. These experiences can help them gain perspective and make informed decisions about their future academic and career goals.

Additionally, taking a gap year can help alleviate burnout and reduce stress levels that students may have experienced throughout high school. With the intense focus on grades and college applications, many students may benefit from taking a break to recharge and refocus.

Finally, the decision to take a gap year should be made on a case-by-case basis. Students should carefully consider their personal goals and circumstances before deciding whether or not to take a break from education.

### 要点

1. 在我看来，休学一年对学生来说是一个很好的机会，可以让他们在进入大学之前获得宝贵的经验，使他们变得成熟。在这段时间里，他们可以探索自己的兴趣，做志愿者，学习新技能，并获得工作经验。这些经验可以帮助他们获得视野，并对他们未来的学术和职业目标做出明智的决定。

2. 此外，利用空档年可以帮助缓解学生在整个高中阶段可能经历的倦怠和减少压力水平。随着对成绩和大学申请的高度关注，许多学生可能从休息充电和重新集中精力中受益。

3. 最终，休学的决定应该在个案的基础上做出。在决定是否休学之前，学生应该仔细考虑他们的个人目标和情况。

## Do you think teenagers should be allowed to sail around the world, solo and unassisted? Discuss your point of view《你认为是否应该允许青少年独自环游世界？讨论一下你的观点。》

The question of whether teenagers should be permitted to sail around the world solo and unassisted sparks a debate surrounding risk, personal development, and parental responsibility. I believe that  teenagers should not engage in dangerous adventures because it can lead to physical and mental harm.

Firstly, the risks involved in dangerous adventures can be severe and even deadly. According to a study published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery, extreme sports participants are at a higher risk of injury or death compared to other athletes. The study found that the most common injuries were dislocations, and head injuries. Moreover, the risk of death was significantly higher in extreme sports, such as base jumping or wingsuit flying. These risks cannot be ignored, and parents should prioritize their children's safety over their desire for adventure.

One real case that highlights the dangers of dangerous adventures is the tragic death of Australian teenager, Jade Fox. In 2014, the 16-year-old died while attempting to climb Mount Everest with her father. Despite being inexperienced and ill-prepared for the harsh conditions, her father encouraged her to pursue the dangerous adventure. Jade's death was a harsh reminder that parents should not push their children to pursue extreme adventures without proper training and preparation.

Secondly, dangerous adventures can have long-term physical and mental effects on teenagers. A study published in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology found that adolescent athletes who participated in extreme sports had a higher risk of developing PTSD and anxiety. The study also found that these athletes were more likely to engage in risky behavior, such as substance abuse and unprotected sex. Research has also shown that risky adventures can have significant negative effects on the developing brains of adolescents.  According to a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, young people who engage in risky behaviors, like extreme sports, are more likely to experience impairments in brain function.  The study found that these negative effects were more pronounced in adolescents who started engaging in risky behaviors at a younger age. These negative effects can have long-lasting consequences on teenagers' mental and physical health, and parents should consider these risks before encouraging their children to pursue dangerous adventures.

In conclusion, The risks involved can be severe and even fatal, and the negative effects on teenagers' mental and physical health can be long-lasting. Real cases like Jade Fox highlight the dangers of pushing children into extreme adventures without proper training and preparation. Children's safety and well-being should be putted over their desire for adventure.

##  《旅行时，有些人喜欢直接到达目的地。还有一些人喜欢停下来，看看沿途的风景。你认为哪种旅行方式更好，为什么？》


When it comes to traveling, individuals have different preferences regarding reaching their destination directly or making scenic stops along the way. This article aims to explore the advantages of both approaches and present an argument for the better way of traveling.

Direct Travel: Efficiency and Time-Saving:
Supporters of direct travel argue that reaching the destination directly offers several advantages. Firstly, it maximizes efficiency, allowing travelers to make the most of their limited time. By avoiding unnecessary detours and extended stops, travelers can reach their destination faster, enabling them to immerse themselves in the desired experiences sooner. Additionally, direct travel eliminates the risk of missing out on key attractions and activities due to time constraints.

Scenic Stops: Immersion and Exploration:
On the other hand, advocates for making scenic stops believe that this approach provides a richer and more immersive travel experience. By pausing along the way, travelers have the opportunity to explore and appreciate the natural beauty, cultural landmarks, and local communities that lie between their departure and destination points. These scenic stops allow for serendipitous discoveries, interactions with locals, and a deeper understanding of the places visited. Moreover, taking time to appreciate the journey itself can enhance the overall enjoyment and create lasting memories.

Striking a Balance:
Rather than favoring one approach over the other, it is essential to strike a balance between efficiency and exploration. Travelers can plan their trips strategically, incorporating selected scenic stops while maintaining a reasonable travel time. This way, they can enjoy the best of both worlds - reaching their destination efficiently while also savoring the experiences along the way.

Conclusion:
Ultimately, the choice between direct travel and making scenic stops depends on personal preferences, time constraints, and the nature of the trip. While direct travel allows for efficient exploration of the destination, scenic stops provide a chance to delve deeper into the journey itself, creating a more immersive travel experience. By striking a balance between the two, travelers can make the most of their time, uncover hidden gems, and create cherished memories.

## 《你认为大学生是否做了足够的运动来保持健康的生活方式？他们在闲暇时间都做些什么？》

Well,many studies suggest that college students are not engaging in sufficient exercise to maintain a healthy lifestyle. They argue that academic workload, lack of time, and sedentary leisure activities are major barriers to physical activity. College students often have busy schedules with classes, exams, and assignments, leaving little time for exercise. Additionally, many students spend their free time engaging in sedentary activities such as watching TV, using social media, or playing video games, which further limits their physical activity. Lack of motivation and access to exercise facilities can also be factors that contribute to insufficient exercise among college students.

Banning athletes found guilty of doping from all future Olympic Games is a necessary step to preserve the integrity and fairness of the competition.

It protects the credibility of the Olympic Games and ensures that clean athletes have an equal chance to succeed based on their talent, dedication, and hard work.

Preserving the Olympic Spirit:
The Olympic Games symbolize values such as integrity, respect, and fair competition. Allowing athletes with a history of doping to compete tarnishes these ideals.
